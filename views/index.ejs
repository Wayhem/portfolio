								<p>This is a small intro about myself, my motivations and my life, if you want to directly see <a href="#work">my work</a> be sure to click the link, hope you like it.</p>
								<p>I once heard a saying that goes by "Everything starts with a dream", however my starts on coding were more likely to be started by a simple motivation. I was born and raised in Venezuela, a country that used to be way much more in so many ways, than it is at the moment. My motivation is simple, I have a dog and her name is Akira, buying barely 5 pounds of food for her is already 2 minimum salaries, so in order to make enough for us to eat, I started trading Cryptos besides my full-time job, Cryptos led to Ethereum, Blockchain, Solidity and Smart Contracts and that finally led to me being a developer! Anyways facts say much more than words so let <a href="#work">my work</a> speak for me.</p>

								<p>In the next section I will show you the links alongside a brief explanation about some of the apps I've made, hope you enjoy!</p>
								<h3 class="major">Ethereum oriented</h3>
								<h4>TrustFund</h4>
								<p><a href="https://trust-fund.herokuapp.com/home">TrustFund</a> is a dApp I made based on two small contracts, the logic of the app is like any other crowdfunding site like Kickstarter/GoFundme, but this time anyone who contributes has a say on what happens with the balance stored on the campaign smart contract, so it basically works like this: Any user starts a campaign and sets a minimum amount to contribute in order to be considered as an "approver", the manager then can make requests stating 3 things, how much ether from the balance will be transferred, which address receives the money, and a description of this request. Then the "approvers" decide whether to ignore or approve the request, the request can only be finalized by the manager and once at least 50% or more of the contributors approved that specific request. Once finalized the request, the money is transferred to the target account. So TrustFund allows contributors to decide to an extent what is done with the money they lend to the managers of every campaign, making scams for Kickstarter projects less likely. If you want to test the app locally, you need to have Metamask installed and <a href="https://github.com/Wayhem/KSC">check my github repository</a> and follow the instructions, to test it in your browser <a href="https://trust-fund.herokuapp.com/home">visit my deployed instance</a> be sure to have Metamask installed and on the rinkeby network for testing. Be sure to contact me for further details.</p>
								<h3 class="major">Full-Stack oriented</h3>
								<h4>Venezuela Tours</h4>
								<p><a href="https://vzlatours.herokuapp.com">Venezuela Tours</a> is a small production site I made which consist in a place where you can store your own toursites(Hotels, Inns, Parks) and set a price per night, you can register and comment on other toursites too posted by other users, Uses a simple MEN stack so any reactiva framework can be applied. Check out the <a href="https://vzlatours.herokuapp.com">app</a> and the code at <a href="https://github.com/Wayhem/vzla-tour">GitHub</a></p>
								<h4>Parking Villa</h4>
								<p><a href="http://45.77.80.170/">Parking Villa</a> is a small app I developed in order to test my skills, I had to learn how to use Vue.js and Laravel and also make this app in only 1 week, it was an app made for a company called <a href="https://www.alegra.com">"Alegra"</a> which is an app for small and medium enterprises accountings, the app consists of parking lot of 10 cells, 5 in the back and 5 upfront, it should be able to park cars using the cell behind before the cell upfront, move the car in front to another cell if it's blocking the car trying to leave and park the car blocking the way in the spot of the one coming out in case parking lot is full. It is also able to keep track of the car coming in and coming out, track the time each spot is being occupied and generate paying tickets with the Alegra remote API. Code is now on my github, <a href="https://github.com/Wayhem/parking-villa">check it out if you wish so</a>, be sure to check out the <a href="http://45.77.80.170/">app</a></p>
